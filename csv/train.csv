32,redvil,,0,hello there..anyone knows an iTunes equivalent app in Ubuntu?
33,ectospasm,redvil,0,I don't know of one that will interface with iTunes
34,ectospasm,redvil,0,there probably won't be one until Apple releases iTunes for Linux (heh.

38,ectospasm,redvil,0,from what to what?
39,redvil,ectospasm,0,thanks anyways..it's just that i've been 'googling' like crazy and couldn't find one

42,ectospasm,redvil,0,gtkpod might be able to do that
43,redvil,ectospasm,0,"ok then, i'll give that one a try..thanks"

170,tucemiux_,Yadira,0,does your monitor have speakers?
171,tucemiux_,Yadira,0,you have to connect a wire that goes from the 'headphone' jack in your laptop to the speakers in your monitor
172,tucemiux_,Yadira,0,"to get full screen is always flaky, since the laptop is opened you might need to hit a combination of keys on your laptop so that the screen goes to the monitor, on my laptop is 'FN +F8', look at your keyboard and you should see a key labeled 'Fn' and should be maybe colored blue, you should see another key labeled something like 'CRT/LCD'"
173,tucemiux_,Yadira,0,you must have to reboot your laptop with the monitor hooked up to the laptop
174,tucemiux_,Yadira,0,sorry i meant to say you ***might***

239,Dr_Willis,saji89,0, it ould i guess.. some keys didetn get signed.. but i guess one could try to install other packages an dsee if they report the same issue.

326,Traintop,,1,Hi Folks!
327,Traintop,,0,Is there an easy way to make my laptop work as a radioclock/alarm while in hotels?
328,Traintop,,0,"ActionParsnip,bazhang: to be more specific; I want to enter a time when I go to bed; turn the laptop off and it then wakes up at the specified time and starts playing a playlist/web-channel/mp3/divx/..."
329,Traintop,,0,I'm using 11.04 and hoped such things would go via GUI
330,mneptok,Traintop,0,"if the laptop is fully off, how is the software that supposed to wake it up supposed to get any CPU time to do its job?"
331,Traintop,mneptok,0,the laptop is connected to AC all night to load the battery; so energy is not the problem; but adjusting the acpi-timer and then start some script/prog to 'wake me up' :-)
332,mneptok,Traintop,0,"you want to tell the BIOS to boot, then create a cronjob to fire up your music."
333,Traintop,mneptok,0,and this still has to be done manually these days?
334,mneptok,Traintop,0,"no, just like MacOS, you only need to visulaize in your mind what you want, and never have to touch the keyboard."
335,mneptok,Traintop,0,('manually?'
336,mneptok,Traintop,0,is there any other way?)
337,mneptok,Traintop,0,plug the phone into the speakers
338,Traintop,mneptok,0,manually != done by package :-)
339,laughter,,0,"hey, I'm currently running bleachbit, it is removing abou 1.5 GB and it has been saying that it is cleaning the system for about 20 minutes?"
340,laughter,,0,is this typical?
341,Dr_Willis,laughter,0," ive noticed it taking a VERY long time also.. i think it may be hanging, OR you selected the clean free area option"
342,laughter,Dr_Willis,0,"i did select the free space option, the idea of freeing a gig of space sounded amazing."
343,laughter,Dr_Willis,0,"it warned it would slow things, but it's been chillin for a while"
344,Dr_Willis,laughter,0, its actually overwriting the free space to 'securely delete' things from how i read the tooltops
345,Dr_Willis,laughter,0, i think that option should proberly be disabled by default.
346,Dr_Willis,laughter,0,:) its a little over paranoid
347,laughter,Dr_Willis,0,"yeah, that's what i was thinking, i have no secrets, so i will never run it again."
348,laughter,Dr_Willis,0,i'll just give it some more time.
349,laughter,Dr_Willis,1,thanks!
350,Dr_Willis,laughter,0, it would be nice if bleachbit also let you know the last time a 'fix' has been ran.
351,Dr_Willis,laughter,0,I dont see the point in doing some of those cleaning tasks more then once a week :)
352,Dr_Willis,laughter,0, i got a 1TB HD.. so it was going to take it some time.
353,Dr_Willis,laughter,0,:)
354,laughter,Dr_Willis,0,"true, i'm fairly religious about deleting old packages and the like, bleachbit will be added to the weekly cleaning!"
355,laughter,Dr_Willis,0,"a window popped up to prompt me that I have 0 bytes remaining and i should empty my trash, i hope that means bleachbit progress, or is this a bug?"
356,laughter,,0,what 's wrong with my top panel?
357,laughter,,0,there are white lines and dots.
358,laughter,,0,any help is appreciated?
359,laughter,,0,http://imgur.com/9qD0u
360,laughter,,0,nothing
361,laughter,,0,"nothing, i cant move cardapio(my menu applet)"
362,laughter,,0,i usually can
363,laughter,,0,"umm, well i switched from elementary to ambiance and that is when the dots and lines appeared"
364,whompapotamus,laughter,0, create another panel by right-clicking on the top panel and see if lines appear - if not - kill the top panel and re-add all of your applets to the new one
365,laughter,whompapotamus,0,no lines on the new panel
366,laughter,whompapotamus,1,thanks
367,whompapotamus,laughter,0,create all of you applets on the new one and delete the old one
368,laughter,whompapotamus,0,will do good sir

371,iSUKatLINUX,xangua,0,"  Okay, I got a puzzle: I installed ubuntu 904 but it gave me no sound."

380,cyy,,0,ok followup question: why are 'root' and 'www-user' running apache and how do i stop that from happening
381,chakal^-^,cyy,0,fuser -v 80/tcp
382,chakal^-^,cyy,0,with sudo before forgiveness
383,cyy,histo,0,"i have no idea why its running, none of the users want it, and I want to use port 80 for something else"
384,chakal^-^,,0,"the parent process is always root, the thread's inherited from the UID / GID of the user / group defined in apache, or www-data: www-data"
385,chakal^-^,,0,That is completely normal cyy
386,cyy,,0,no I don't need apache installed
387,cyy,,0,yeah
388,cyy,,0,is it running by default with ubuntu or did someone manage to install it accidentally?
389,chakal^-^,cyy,0,are reading me?
390,BPower,,0,Anyone know of file splitting/joining software that works on both Ubuntu and Windows
391,BPower,,0,?
392,MikeChelen,BPower,0,7zip with .rar or .tar?
393,BPower,MikeChelen,0,Oh.
394,BPower,MikeChelen,0,Didn't know you could do that with 7zip.
395,BPower,MikeChelen,0,I'll try that out.
396,BPower,MikeChelen,1,Thanks
397,MikeChelen,BPower,0,"check which file formats it supports, probably ones allows splitting"
398,BPower,MikeChelen,1,thanks!
399,BPower,MikeChelen,0,:) I'm going to try now on the Windows side.
400,BPower,MikeChelen,0,brb
401,BPower,MikeChelen,0,you're the best :) Thanks for pointing out 7zip for me
402,MikeChelen,BPower,0,"there are tons of good archive programs for linux, 7zip is nice though for being crossplatform :)"
403,BPower,MikeChelen,0,agreed
404,BPower,MikeChelen,0,Okay so I just split the file and was finally able to successfully transfer everything over to my other computer (running Ubuntu).
405,BPower,MikeChelen,0,Now I need to join them again...
406,BPower,MikeChelen,0,I can't find any documentation on how to do this via 7zip's command line....
407,TrentH,,0,idlecool; what is it doing?
408,TrentH,,0,BPower
409,TrentH,,0,xrandr -configure
410,TrentH,,0,--configure
411,TrentH,,0,or -config or --config
412,TrentH,,0,"one fo those, ^-^"
413,TrentH,,0,"Ask your ISP, what your DNS settings are suppose to be."
414,BPower,TrentH,0,neither worked....
415,BPower,TrentH,0,I added a resolution to my monitor (it wasn't giving me high enough resolutions) and positioned it.
416,TrentH,BPower,0,Take a look @ this link.

418,bastid_raZor,,0,!hostname | BPower
419,BPower,bastid_raZor,0,"ActionParsnip: thanks, but how do I just find out what it is?"
420,bastid_raZor,BPower,0,/etc/hostname  .. as the factoid states
421,bastid_raZor,BPower,0,or type hostname in a terminal and press enter
422,bastid_raZor,BPower,0,in synaptic search linux-image and uninstall all the kernels you don't want
423,bastid_raZor,BPower,0,sudo service gdm stop   ..if you're using gnome
424,BPower,bastid_raZor,0,thanks i'll try that and be back soon
425,BPower,bastid_raZor,0,what was it again?
426,BPower,bastid_raZor,0,My clipboard didn't copy it for some reason
427,bastid_raZor,BPower,0,sudo service gdm stop
428,BPower,bastid_raZor,0,"thanks, got it this time."
429,BPower,bastid_raZor,0,be back soon
430,abuayyoub,,0,would you like me to send you what I could get iceroot?
431,abuayyoub,,0,Jul  1 00:25:26 ubun2 anacron[1498]: Normal exit (1 job run)
432,abuayyoub,,0,let me send you the error

434,erUSUL,abuayyoub,0,https://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Libata_error_messages
435,abuayyoub,erUSUL,0,that looks like the error yes.
436,erUSUL,abuayyoub,0,UNC --> Uncorrectable error - often due to bad sectors on the disk
437,abuayyoub,erUSUL,0,I see... no way to fix it?>
438,erUSUL,abuayyoub,0,well seing more lines of the dmesg would help... maybe you can see what smart says ( system>Admin>disk utility )
439,abuayyoub,erUSUL,0,ok let me check it out.
440,red,,0,Anyone experiencing _terrible_ framerates with compiz enabled?
441,red,,0,Was formerly on the alpha lucid lynx build - but now with the final release I'm like 20-30fps on compiz
442,red,,0,which is quite odd
443,talmai,red,0,"open hardware drivers in administration and look if there's a newer graphic driver, helped me"
444,red,talmai,0,I'm using the same driver than I used before reinstall
445,red,,0,and im already on the newer one
446,red,,0,or should I try to get latest via aptitude?
447,talmai,red,0,"yes, I did too and it was choppy."
448,talmai,red,0,"not anymore, since I updated to the latest one"
449,red,talmai,0,well theres the 173 and the newer one
450,talmai,red,0,"I don't know, I had 173 and switched to the recommended one"
451,Kills,,0,took me 15 mins
452,Kills,,0,is there anyway i can just disable my laptop internal sound speakers
453,Kills,,0,Soundmax?
454,Kills,,0,maybe youre in the wriong language
455,Kills,,0,wait Ill try
456,Kills,,0,It wont work because the notepad doesnt have those letters i think
457,Kills,,0,try using another program
458,Kills,,0,linux has sound problems
459,Kills,,0,try notepad ++ if you like notepad that bad or use other programs like ope office ones
460,linx|,Kills,0,yes
461,rtaycher,,0,also the mouse tends to drift a bit but I dont know if its a seperate problem
462,rtaycher,,0,"and its not just for a bit of time, once left clicking stops working it doesn't work again"
463,nvz,rtaycher,0,my thoughts on the subject would be both checking the device itself i.e.
464,nvz,rtaycher,0,"catting the device and see if its producing output when you're not touching it, and also checking what kind of weird input devices are configured via your xorg.conf or xorg.log"
465,nvz,rtaycher,0,"but as you mentioned this is a thinkpad and I know them well, it has a tracknav (two pointing devices) I know as they get old and dirty they tend to have these kinds of issues"
466,rtaycher,nvz,0,The laptop is fairly new and clicking doesn't work on touchpad or tracknav buttons
467,rtaycher,nvz,0,/dev/input/mouse0 is silent but /dev/input/mouse1 gives 2800 ff28 00ff in hex over and over
468,nvz,rtaycher,0,"sounds like as I thought, something is wonky with the device itself.. either the connection is bad or its dirty..etc.."
469,nvz,rtaycher,0,I frequently had problems with my trackpoint doing the moving to the side thing until I cleaned it real good and put a new rubber tip on it.
470,nvz,rtaycher,0,never had the clicking issue though
471,rtaycher,nvz,0,thanks for the help.
472,rtaycher,nvz,0,I hope I can figure out the clicking issues
473,nvz,rtaycher,0,I'd move on to physical troubleshooting..
474,nvz,rtaycher,0,I'm a certified tech but its not really rocket science even if you aren't.
475,nvz,rtaycher,0,Thinkpads have clearly marked screw holes on the bottom for which ones take off the keyboard to get in there and check the connections and for the most part those keyboards can be washed in the sink.. heh just gotta dry well before reconnecting
476,nvz,rtaycher,0,often the ram sits right below the tracknav and that heat could've done damage as well.. depends on how old it is and how well taken care of
477,yogesh712harish,,0,Dr_willis: are you there
478,yogesh712harish,,0,can anybody help me for creating iso image.
479,erUSUL,,0,sorry typo
480,yogesh712harish,,0,hello guys can anyone help me for crating iso image in ubuntu 9.04
481,erUSUL,yogesh712harish,0,sudo dd if=/dev/sr0 of=thedisk.iso  && sudo chowo $USER:$USER thedisk.iso
482,erUSUL,yogesh712harish,0,sudo dd if=/dev/sr0 of=thedisk.iso  && sudo chown $USER:$USER thedisk.iso
483,yogesh712harish,erUSUL,0,i will try it
484,erUSUL,yogesh712harish,0,also you can use brasero or any other burning program to create an iso
485,yogesh712harish,,1,erUsul: thank you sir...
486,erUSUL,yogesh712harish,1,no problem
487,milosh,,0,anyone know a good windows password recovery tool?
488,hunahpu,milosh,0,"trinity-rescue-kit, is a distro designed specifically for your case (recovering/reseting win passwords)"
489,hunahpu,milosh,0,right click the .iso file and then click on 'burn to CD'
490,hunahpu,milosh,0,alternatively you can create a bootable USB flash memory (pendrive) with it.
491,hunahpu,milosh,0,(system - admin - usb creator)
492,hunahpu,milosh,0,"open brasero, it will display 5 big buttons, pick the last one (burn image)"
493,hunahpu,milosh,0,brasero should work just fine; burning an iso file is not that hard; I also like gnomebaker more though (it plays a cool sound when it ends!)
494,hunahpu,milosh,0,"I personally help people 'for fun', is better than just keeping my sit warm while I'm at work :)"
495,milosh,hunahpu,0,well that's really cool of you man
496,hunahpu,milosh,0,if you want to be extra-safe at 1-4x but it will take some time
497,hunahpu,milosh,0,"use 24.0 x,"

515,Zelozelos,jason8,0,"did u have a confusion about it, a queston or what?"
516,Zelozelos,jason8,0,"because a monitor physically connected works via hardware and some software, using a tv as a monitor is all software (unless its a monitor/tv that attaches via monitor cable)"

522,jrib,Zelozelos,0,what is your question?
523,Zelozelos,jrib,0,that is my q
524,Zelozelos,,0,"rofl, i want to backup only those settings, i ws wondering the best way"

526,Zelozelos,jrib,0,did u see the rest of my statements
527,jrib,Zelozelos,0,no.
528,jrib,Zelozelos,0,I just got here and read one line.
529,jrib,Zelozelos,0,in general with a large channel like #ubuntu you shouldn't split things up on multiple lines unless you're addressing someone
530,jrib,Zelozelos,0,copy them somewhere?
531,jrib,Zelozelos,0,Have you seen the backup page on the wiki for more complete backup solutions?

534,undecim,Zelozelos,0,Purging won't erase your user settings.
535,undecim,Zelozelos,0,That you will find in .config/gnome-do.
536,undecim,Zelozelos,0,"If you kill gnome-do and then delete that folder, that will clear gnome-do's settings completely."
537,Zelozelos,undecim,0,is this the reccomended course?
538,Zelozelos,undecim,0,or should i attempt to find the error in the settings?
539,undecim,Zelozelos,0,Deleting the directory is what I would do if I was having problems with Do.
540,undecim,Zelozelos,0,Unless you really don't want to kill your history and settings.
541,undecim,Zelozelos,0,"Also, I was wrong about the directory."
542,undecim,Zelozelos,0,Here is a list of gnome-do directories I found in my home folder: http://paste.ubuntu.com/425627/
543,undecim,Zelozelos,0,to see any files that start with '.
544,undecim,Zelozelos,0,"', you need to press Ctrl + H in the file manager, or use the '-a' option with ls if you are in the terminal"
545,Zelozelos,undecim,0,"thank you, i usually just goto view, view hidden files in nautilus ;)"
546,undecim,Zelozelos,0,"Also, rename the directories or leave them in the trash instead of deleting them."
547,undecim,Zelozelos,0,You can try one directory at a time and see if it fixes whatever issues you are having.
548,Zelozelos,undecim,0,"good idea, thank you again"
549,Zelozelos,undecim,0,i bet its gonna be local/share ill start there
